## Summary
**Goal:** Fix Add Sale functionality, redesign UI components with Bangladesh flag-inspired colors, and add an optional Timer/Reminder feature.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix Add Sale Submit button to properly save sales to localStorage and display in History immediately
- Update Today's Sales counter on Home screen to reflect newly added sales
- Allow Add Sale form submission with any one or more fields filled (remove requirement for all fields)
- Replace theme colors (Orange Sunset, Red Passion, Golden Amber) with Red, Green, and Black inspired by Bangladesh flag
- Redesign Quick Actions buttons on Home screen with improved visual styling
- Improve Splash screen tagline design while keeping "Manage your shop efficiently" text, displayed in Bangla or English based on Settings
- Add Timer/Reminder toggle in Settings to enable/disable the feature
- Create Dynamic Island-style compact timer display below Quick Actions when enabled
- Add timer setting modal that opens when clicking the timer display
- Implement browser notifications when timer reaches zero
- Update timer display to show real-time countdown

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully add sales that appear immediately in History, customize the app with Bangladesh flag colors (Red, Green, Black), enjoy improved UI design for Quick Actions and Splash screen, and optionally enable a timer/reminder feature with browser notifications.
