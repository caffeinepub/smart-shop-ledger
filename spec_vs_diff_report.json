  "summary": "All four requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 (sound button redesign) is addressed in Settings.tsx with new MicOff/Music icons and a pill-style dual-icon button. REQ-2 (4 new premium codes) is implemented in PremiumModal.tsx and Settings.tsx with codes 123321, 456654, 789987, 321123 plus the original 987987. REQ-3 (unit selector in AddSale and ProductList) is implemented in both pages with DropdownMenu components and LanguageContext-driven labels. REQ-4 (translation keys) is implemented in translations.ts with a new 'units' section. Implementation looks complete with no clearly missing requirements and one hallucinated feature (piece unit).",

      "description": "A 'piece' unit option was added to the unit selector dropdown in both AddSale and ProductList pages, and a corresponding 'units.piece' translation key was added to translations.ts.",
      "reason": "The build request only requested gram, kg, and liter as unit options. The 'piece' unit was not requested in REQ-3 or REQ-4.",
