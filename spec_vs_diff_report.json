  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested features including toast notifications, ad banners, premium redesign, premium modal, language support, and splash screen redesign. However, several specific requirements have gaps or missing details.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Toast must respect active language (Bengali or English) for all visible text including timestamp label.",
      "reason": "In NotificationToast.tsx, the text 'এখনই' is hardcoded in Bengali rather than using a translation key, violating the language-aware requirement.",

        "frontend/src/components/NotificationToast.tsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Toast must appear after any trust completion in addition to task completion.",
      "reason": "The diff shows task completion triggering notifications but there is no explicit evidence that trust/credit item completion triggers the toast notification as specifically required.",

      "reason": "In TaskListPopup.tsx the hint text '২ সেকেন্ড ধরে রাখুন কাজ সম্পন্ন করতে' is hardcoded in Bengali. In Lists.tsx strings like 'আমার তালিকা' and 'My Lists' are hardcoded inline rather than using t() calls.",

      "reason": "SplashScreen.tsx uses an inline SVG drawn directly in the component rather than loading the image asset from frontend/public/assets/generated/ssl-logo.dim_512x512.png as specified. No image file was added in the diff.",
